## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and CSS variables
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite integration

### Key Components

#### Data Models
- **EuroMillions Combinations**: Stores all possible combinations with position tracking
- **Draw History**: Historical lottery draw results with jackpot amounts
- **Predictions**: AI-generated predictions with confidence scores
- **Jackpot Data**: Real-time jackpot amounts in EUR and ZAR
- **Users**: Basic user authentication system

#### Services Layer
- **EuroMillions Service**: Fetches historical draw data from external APIs
- **Currency Service**: Real-time EUR to ZAR exchange rate conversion
- **Prediction Service**: Machine learning-based prediction algorithms
- **Combinations Service**: Manages all 139+ million possible combinations

#### Frontend Features

## Data Flow

1. **Data Initialization**: Historical draws are fetched from EuroMillions API and stored in PostgreSQL
2. **Position Calculation**: Each combination is assigned a unique position (1-139,838,160)
3. **Gap Analysis**: Calculate gaps between consecutive draw positions for pattern recognition
4. **Prediction Generation**: ML algorithms analyze patterns to predict next winning combination
5. **Real-time Updates**: Jackpot amounts and exchange rates refresh every 2 minutes
6. **User Interface**: React components display data with real-time updates via React Query

## External Dependencies

- **Currency API**: `https://latest.currency-api.pages.dev/v1/currencies` for EUR/ZAR exchange rates
- **Fallback Currency API**: `https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/EUR`

### Key Libraries
- **Database**: `drizzle-orm`, `@neondatabase/serverless`
- **UI Components**: `@radix-ui/*` family for accessible components

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Uses Vite dev server with hot reload
- Express server runs on Node.js with TypeScript compilation
- Database migrations with Drizzle Kit
- Replit-specific plugins for development environment

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds optimized static assets
- Backend: ESBuild bundles server code with external dependencies
- Database: Drizzle push for schema deployment
- Single-command deployment with `npm run build && npm start`

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

### Architecture Decisions

#### Database Choice
- **PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM**: Chosen for reliability, ACID compliance, and JSON support for number arrays
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL for scalability and cost efficiency
- **Alternative**: Could use SQLite for simpler deployments, but PostgreSQL chosen for production scalability

#### Prediction Strategy
- **Gap Analysis**: Primary method analyzing position gaps between consecutive draws
- **Statistical Patterns**: Frequency analysis of numbers and lucky stars
- **Machine Learning**: Placeholder for more sophisticated algorithms
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides accuracy estimates for predictions

#### Real-time Updates
- **Polling Strategy**: React Query refetches data at intervals (2 minutes for jackpot, 5-10 minutes for other data)
- **Alternative**: WebSocket connections considered but polling chosen for simplicity
- **Background Jobs**: Server-side scheduled tasks for data updates

#### UI/UX Design
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Accessibility**: Radix UI components ensure WCAG compliance
- **Performance**: Vite for fast builds, React Query for efficient data fetching
- **Component Architecture**: Modular components with clear separation of concerns
