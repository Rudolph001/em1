Build a full-stack EuroMillions analysis and prediction web app with the following features:

✅ Core Functionality:
- Display **all 139,838,160 EuroMillions number combinations** (5 numbers from 1–50 and 2 Lucky Stars from 1–12)
- Show **which combinations have already been drawn** using historical data (last 1+ years, scraped from EuroMillions API or official website)
- Identify and display **combinations that have never been played**
- Check if a given combination has ever appeared in the draw history
- Analyze all past draws and build a **machine learning model** that learns from patterns to predict the next number set
- Give 1 **predicted combination per upcoming draw** with a stated 90% success target
- Update the model every Tuesday and Friday (after results are published)
- Self-learns from errors in prediction and adjusts future predictions

📈 Jackpot and Currency Display:
- Fetch the **current EuroMillions jackpot amount** (from a live data source)
- Display the jackpot in **EUR and ZAR**
- Fetch **EUR → ZAR exchange rate** in real-time using a reliable currency API
- Automatically update these values every 2 minutes

📊 Predictions:
- Base prediction on statistical patterns like:
    - Frequency of numbers over time
    - Hot & cold number trends
    - Gap analysis and number spread
    - Machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest or LSTM model trained on draw sequences)

🔁 Automation:
- Use scheduled background jobs (e.g., `cron` jobs or `setInterval`) to:
    - Update jackpot and exchange rate every 2 minutes
    - Pull draw results on Tuesdays and Fridays
    - Retrain model after each draw

💻 Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React or Vite + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask) or Node.js
- Data: SQLite or PostgreSQL to store draw history and combination flags
- ML: scikit-learn or TensorFlow for prediction engine
- APIs:
    - EuroMillions results data (official or third-party)
    - Currency exchange API (like exchangerate.host or OpenExchangeRates)

Optional:
- Add authentication to track user prediction history
- Option to export remaining unplayed combinations
- Dashboard with charts showing prediction accuracy over time
